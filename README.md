# silent-scope
SilentScope is a lightweight passive reconnaissance tool built in Python. It gathers DNS records, WHOIS data, and subdomains using open OSINT sourcesâ€”without sending direct probes to the target infrastructure. Ideal for red teamers, threat analysts, and cybersecurity researchers conducting safe, stealthy intelligence collection.
